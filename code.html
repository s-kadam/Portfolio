				<h1>University of Georgia</h1>
				<p>
					I started coding in the spring of 2017, right before I started my senior year. At the time, I was double majoring in Public Relations and Political Science . I had fallen out of love with that discipline, as I was searching for something that would entice the left side of my brain a bit more. I took an intro to coding class and I really enjoyed it.  
				</p>
				<p>
					During my time at UGA, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work there as well. I was a student web developer for the <a href="ovpi.uga.edu">Office of Instruction</a>. The Office of Instruction was in charge of all of the academic related departments that did not have any direct courses and I made websites for all those departments. For example,  I built and maintained websites for the <a href="https://honesty.uga.edu/">Academic Honesty</a> department, or the <a href="http://doubledawgs.uga.edu/">Double Dawgs Program</a>, or the <a href="https://reg.uga.edu/">Registar</a>. I was fortunate to work there for the two years I was finishing my computer science degree.   
				</p>
				<p>
					I took a lot of really interesting courses while I was at UGA. I got the opportunity to take Web Development and Human Computer Interaction. One of my favorite courses I took was Android Development. You can find some code exmaples of projects I've worked on on my <a href="https://github.com/s-kadam">Github</a>.

				<h1>Experience at Amazon</h1>
			<p>
				After a year of learning how to code, I was fortunate to get an internship at Amazon in Seattle, Washington. During the internship I was able to increase productivity for the Content Aquisition Management Team by over 100%. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Prime Video has two types of content providers: contracted providers, like HBO or Paramount, who might have hundreds of titles they would want on prime video, and individual providers, independent filmmakers who have a handful of titles they would like to publish on prime video. In order for those indie filmmakers to publish videos to prime video, we would have to grant them permissions to publish titles manually. This manual process would require a request from the filmmaker, and then, the CAM team would have to manually create an authorized account for the filmmaker to use. This would include setting the territories in which they could publish, how long their account would have permissions, etc. From the time the filmmaker had indicated they wanted a PVD account to when they actually got it, it would be about two weeks. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to fix this, we created a system which we called PVD tokens. Let's say a user wants to create a prime video account to distribute their  We created an internal form UI which the CAM team could fill out based on information provided by the content creator. When a content creator indicated they wanted to create an account, all the CAM team needed to do was review the information and fill out a form. This form generated a unique "token", which was emailed to the content provider. Using this "token", the content provider could create a prime video direct account already set up and begin uploading videos to Prime. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I returned to Amazon after I graduated. One of the biggest tasks I worked on when I started working there full time was a UI enhancement of the current Request Manager Page. The banner at the top of the page was not working, and there were many inaccuracies in the data for our requests. My first major project was fixing inaccuracies in our counting of requests, and create a live-updating banner tool which allowed users to filter through their fullfilled, open, due, past due, errored, requests.<br>I also built a datawarehouse solution which allowed the BI team to view and manipulate previously unavailable data.
