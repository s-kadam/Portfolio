		Music has always been my first passion. I have been playing music ever since I was in 4th grade when I picked up the viola. In 6th grade I started learning the upright bass because my orchestra teacher needed more bass players, and I decided to volunteer.

		A few months later I started playing the guitar. My life has never been the same since then. I remember diving head first into the guitar world as an 11-year old. I remember teaching myself the intro to "Missisippi Queen" in my bedroom, and performing my irrythmic version of "All The Small Things" for my friends.

		Throughout high school, I taught guitar to a handful of students and started numerous bands with my friends. We had a blast creating music all the time, and when I look back to my high school experience, so much of it is filled with music. In High school, I also organized a music festival called WillStock.

		In college, I started a band with three of my friends called Honeywheel. We were fortunate enough to be able to record and EP and play many shows in in our town, Athens, GA. You can listen to our EP, "Shadowboxing", on Spotify below or any streaming platform of choice.
