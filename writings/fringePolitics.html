	<h3 class="writingTitles">The Emergence of Fringe Politics in the Face of Imminent Globalization</h3>

	<p>

		The technological revolution of the late 20th/early 21st century has exponentially increased humankind’s rate of scientific progress. This progress is moving so fast as it is becoming difficult for laypeople to keep up with the constant new inventions and breakthroughs in technology. One of the most polarizing externalities of the technological revolution is globalization – the process of integration and interaction among the people, companies, and governments of different nations, driven by international trade and investment. Globalization is likely imminent in a world where technological progress is constant and undying. To those on the left, this process is alluring, as it promotes multiculturalism and the integration of different groups. To those on the far-right, however, globalization represents a permanent break from tradition and conventionalism, and as a result, authoritarian fringe-right parties, policies, and leaders are emerging globally, ironically bolstered by the prevalence and diversity of the news media and social media.

		The vote on Brexit and Donald Trump’s victory in the US Election shows an emerging movement in right-wing politics - the “alt-right” or alternative right. Liberals classify this movement as one that promotes white nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, misogyny, and interestingly enough, center-right politicians have also dismissed the far-right with some of the same terms. This is not to say the entirety of the alt-right movement is racist, or misogynistic, etc., but it is evident that the alt-right has given a voice to racists, Neo-Nazi groups, white nationalists, misogyny, etc. While the terms dubbed to the alt-right are disputable, alt-righters strongly unite in support of anti-immigration policy, a desire for strong authority, and anti-establishment politics. Alt-righters are generally working class, middle-aged, white males, who feel their traditional way of life has been threatened by the prominence of leftist policy and increased interconnectedness to the world.

		Characteristics of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) are ubiquitous among alt-right policy. In his article, Altemeyer defines RWA as a personality characteristic with three major features: the uncritical submission to authority (authoritarian submission), aggression towards those who deviate from the norm or the establishment (aggression), and a rigid conformity to conventional values (conventionalism) (Altemeyer). Social Dominance Orientation is a personality trait that is characterized as the extent to which one desires that one’s “in-group” dominates and is superior to the “out-group” (Pratto).

		It isn’t difficult to see the prominence of these personality traits in the alt-right movement. These alt-righters are driven by fear – fear of the out-group, of an interconnected globe, and of what they perceive as progressive liberal policy. These fears indicate a drift from conventional, traditional values to alt-righters. Deriving from this fear is a sense of crude, unrelenting nationalism – the idea that if they aren’t from here, they shouldn’t be here.  This results in rhetoric that suggests that the people are not safe, and danger is imminent.

		More and more countries around the world are jumping on the alt-right bandwagon. The United Kingdom voted to leave the EU in July 2016, and the “leave” campaign in the UK largely promoted the notion of closed borders, and stricter immigration policy. The election of Rodrigo Duterte in the Phillipines thrived on Duterte’s promise to rid the country of all drug traffickers, drug users, etc. Since his election, Duterte has killed numerous amounts of accused drug users/traffickers, without due process of law. The anti-immigration sentiment is growing in Hungary as well, with the increase in popularity of the Jobbik party since the Syrian refugee crisis. France has seen a boost in support for its far right party, the National Front, after last year’s terror attacks in Paris and Nice. Most recently, the United States elected Donald Trump, who targeted Muslims and Mexicans (along with other minority groups) during his campaign. However, this global trend of alt-right, anti-immigration sentiment far from surprising. Interestingly enough, the tool that once promised to connect the world is being used to divide it.

		The beautiful, yet terrifying facet of the internet is its free and equal access for most of the globe. It is a place where people can create and share their ideas. Congruent with the rise of the internet is the rise of a plethora of online news sources, representing ideology ranging from the far-right to the far-left. While it is an amazing feat that anyone can publish their thoughts publicly on a forum where it can be subject to debate and scrutiny, the publication of falsehoods/incomplete stories on the internet has become rampant. Online news sources, along with social media, are working themselves into the political socialization of the general public. , as more and more people are receiving their news from online sources, as opposed to TV news, or newspapers. The Pew Research Center found that about 62% of Americans get their news from social media (Gottfried).

		The tragedy of social media and online news is the public’s ability to pick and choose where they get their news from. Cognitive Dissonance is defined as the mental stress one feels when presented with beliefs, ideas, or values that differ from their own. Festinger’s theory of cognitive dissonance focuses on how humans naturally strive for internal consistency (Festinger). This has been accentuated by social media and online news. The ability for people to pick and choose where they get their news from, or who is on their social media news feed presents a problem in regards to political polarization. When a person logs onto Facebook, or Twitter, etc., the company filters what the consumer is seeing, in order to provide what it believes would be the most pleasant feed to the consumer. Instead of understanding the other side and finding areas to compromise, social media has made the right more steadfast right-wing ideology, while doing the same to the left. According to Festinger, humans strive for internal consistency and the internet provides that. There becomes no need for discourse, because if one logs onto their social network, they are flooded with a feed of people who are sharing posts which are congruent with the user’s beliefs. This discourages discourse, and leads to the increased polarization of politics – namely the intrusion of the alt-right in mainstream global politics.

		The internet does a fine job mongering fear. With ISIS propaganda readily available, a plethora of war videos on YouTube, and the domination of the Syrian Refugee Crisis in world news, it is no question that the fear mongering tactics of the alt-right have come to prominence. The internet provides intimacy to people who are thousands of miles apart, thus creating a perception that danger is much closer than it actually is – it’s right on the computer screen, in one’s home! Reasonably speaking, the chances of the majority of the United States population dying due to terror is slim to nil, however, the perception is quite the opposite, evidenced by Trump’s election. The immediate portrayal of danger on a computer screen instills fear among the public, the majority of whom feel scared and desire a strong leader that will protect them.

		The irony of the many roles the internet plays in politics is remarkable. It achieves (and is continually achieving) its goal of an interconnected globe, however, it also fosters fear that the world is moving too fast in the other direction. It makes terrorism or war that is thousands of miles away seem too close for comfort. It creates the notion that traditional/conventional values will be trampled in the face of globalization. In the midst of all the fear plaguing the world, alt-right parties and policies emerge like a phoenix rising from the ashes, bringing promises of stricter immigration policy, stronger/more militant leadership, and crude nationalism. In the face of globalization and exponential scientific and technological progress, fear is winning around the globe.
