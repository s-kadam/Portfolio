		The German use of nationalism during the Third Reich was propagandistic, dirty, and bred off racist ideology. The Nazis “appear not to have replaced nationalism with racism, but to have cultivated and implemented a racist concept of the nation” (Wolff 89). This nationalism was vital to the fascist regime of Adolf Hitler, as it was the vehicle that upheld the Third Reich. Using artistic works and other academic sources, this paper will serve to show the intimate relationship between fascism and nationalism by analyzing the psychological and economic tendencies behind Nazi ideology and Adolf Hitler.

		Nationalism can be generally defined as pride in one’s country, but nationalism in the context of fascism went a step further, associating nation with a race of people, instead of a geographical point. There are three qualities of fascist nationalism, the first being the “attribution of exclusive qualities” (Wolff 90). This provides “excessive and redemptive pride” to the collective membership. The second is the “promotion of particularistic solidarity” (Wolff 90) which promotes unity. The third is the “prioritization of national interests over individual interests and the needs of other collectives” (Wolff 90). German nationalism of the Third Reich was based off of the idea that a true German, Aryan race should exist. Qualities such as blue eyes or blond hair were favorable in Nazi Germany. Hitler’s promotion of these exclusive traits as inherently German was vital to promote unity in the Third Reich. Hitler’s economic policy played into this preservation of Nazi nationalism, by giving private property rights to those businesses who furthered state interests. Although Hitler’s nationalism was propped up by racist, authoritarian, and anti-capitalist tendencies, “his status of a man appealing to apparently traditional values and the absence of any connection with a specific group” brought the rise of the Third Reich (Guiran 322).

		Hitler’s fierce nationalism can be aligned with traits of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). Altemeyer classifies authoritarianism with having three major features: authoritarian submission, aggression, and conventionalism. Submission refers to submission to authorities that are dedicated to overthrowing established authorities. Aggression refers to aggression towards established authorities, and conventionalism refers to a belief in traditional values. Hitler himself exhibited all three of these tendencies, some of which are seen in Downfall.  
	</p>

		In Downfall, we see Hitler exhibit authoritarian tendencies in the scene where his Generals tell him that Steiner was not able to mobilize enough men for an assault. In this scene, Hitler rages over the lack of obedience in his staff (Eichinger). This scene certainly shows traits of aggression and submission within Hitler. Even the simple fact that people refer to Hitler as “Mein Führer” is indicative of Hitler’s authoritarian submission tendency. It has been suggested that people who exhibit authoritarian tendencies were not able to project aggression onto their parents, so they project it onto others (Altemeyer). This most certainly seems to be the case with Hitler, as he was mistreated by his father as a child. This upbringing played a major role in the authoritarian style nationalism of the Nazi regime.

		Social dominance orientation is an “attitudinal orientation toward intergroup relations, reflecting whether one generally prefers such relations to be equal versus hierarchical” (Pratto, Sidanius and Stallworth). Generally, this means the preference or belief of the greatness of a certain “in-group” over an “out-group”. Hitler most likely had a high level of social dominance orientation as he desired a solely Aryan society and professed his dominance over Jewish people. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This intergroup dynamic in Nazi Germany was brilliantly captured in Maus: A Survivor’s Tale. In the graphic novel, the animal that a character is is based on nationality - Germans are cats, Americans are dogs, the French are Frogs, and the Polish are pigs. The exception is every Jew in Maus is a mouse (Spiegelman, Maus : A Survivor's Tale). Every group is defined by their nationality in the book except for the Jews. This subtle heartbreaking detail strips nationality from the Jews, and replaces it with a symbol of fragility and vulnerability. The Germans stripped the Jews of their nationalities and reduced them to their religion. A scene in Maus shows a mouse begging to the German cats to let him go, as he is a German just like them. In response, the Germans beat the Jew without regard to his nationality.  Both these factors help to create an image that displays the social dominance orientation of the Nazi regime. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism are characterized by strongman leadership, conventional beliefs, and relentless nationalism, traits which Nazi Germany portrayed and used in creating their own brand of fascist nationalism. The qualities of fascist nationalism above intertwine with characteristics of SDO and RWA. These characteristics show the psychological backgrounds of Nazi ideology and the traits that were the breeding ground for the rise of Nazi nationalism.

		The Nazi economy also perpetuated Nazi nationalism. Hitler’s economy was based on the “principle of competition (Social Darwinism), the protection of one’s race and the belief in personalities” (Szejnmann). Hitler wanted to replace the capitalistic economic system with a system that had immense state oversight, but still allowed private initiative that served the common good (Eatwell). In this respect, signs were put on Jewish stores in order to dissuade people from going to them, taxes were introduced on Jewish income; policies that would help the natural German and hurt the Jew were put into place. Depreciating the value of Jews and Jewish goods was a method of fostering German nationalism as the Nazis were creating public opinion that Jews were inherently bad for the national interest and the national economy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although they referred to themselves as “anti-capitalists” (Eatwell), the Nazis protected one of the core tenets of capitalism – private property. In Maus, we saw that Jews still had the safety of their homes in the first half of the Third Reich. It was only until the war started picking up when the Nazis would barge into Jewish houses to take them to concentration camps. Even then, the Nazis had warrants and legal reason to be in those houses. The fact that there were legal measures put in place for this sort of mass eradication was chilling. Laws were passed to oppress Jews, and due to those laws, it became nationalistic to oppress.   
	</p>
	<p>
		Roger Eatwell, in his 1992 article, asserted that “fascism sought to create what social science would call a new ‘political culture.’” In Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler wrote that factors of blood or politics were of greater importance than economics to him (Eatwell 180). This guiding principle in Hitler’s life led him towards belief in a society with one true Aryan race and where politics was primacy. Hitler’s new political culture involved the oppression of those deemed to be lower than him, and was characterized by unfettered pride in the German state. 
	</p>

		In Downfall, a scene towards the beginning of the film portrays Hitler’s idealistic nationalism. In the scene, Hitler stands before a model of futuristic Berlin, remarking on how after the war, the city will stand among the ancient great cities of the world. It would be a hotbed of culture and art, and in the center would be the government building, overlooking the proud metropolis that it has built (Eichinger). This remarkable scene displays Hitler’s unrelenting nationalism without showing rarely any of the negativity that lurks behind it. Even in the face of imminent defeat, Hitler was idealizing a Berlin that would transcend politics and culture, an indication of his relentless nationalism.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nazi nationalism was tied deeply to Hitler, as traits of SDO and RWA in an ideology can only be exhibited if the leader expresses such traits. Nazi society was based on this relentless nationalism, as most facets of socioeconomic life pointed towards a form of nationalism in the Third Reich. German fascism would not have existed without its romance with itself – fascism provides the perfect breeding ground for nationalistic tendency, and it is difficult for fascism to exist without nationalism.
