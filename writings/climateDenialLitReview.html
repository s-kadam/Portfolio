			<h2 style="text-align: center">Climate Change Denial Tactics and Effects on Voting Behavior</h2>
			<p>15 September 2016</p>
			
			<p>
				The United States has thus far seen many environmental catastrophes in 2016 - from hurricane Hermine touching down in Florida, to almost half of the state of Louisiana experiencing flooding, to droughts that are halting the agricultural development of the West – yet the public dialogue linking these disasters and climate change is slim to nil. Needless to say, this paper will be sympathetic to the argument of the overwhelming supermajority of climate scientists who assert that climate change is a real threat and caused by humans. Although the scientific community has basically reached consensus on this issue, climate change continues to be a deeply polarizing topic in American politics, with discourse from leaders like the current Republican Presidential Nominee, Donald Trump, describing climate change as an elaborate Chinese “hoax” (Jacobson).
			</p>
			<p>
				Denial of climate change continues to bar Congress from taking robust action to attempt to reverse its imminent effects. With the recent emergence of radical right-wing groups such as the Tea Party, the United States has seen a drop in belief in global warming. A 2007 Harris Interactive poll found that 71% of Americans believed in global warming and that number dropped to 51% in 2009. The number of people who did not believe rose from 23% to 29%. What is interesting about this poll is that the number of American’s who are not sure about global warming jumped from 6% to 21% (Taylor). A poll done in 2015 by the Pew Research Center found that 45% of Americans view climate change as a “very serious problem”, a rise from the 37% that held this opinion in 2010. Interestingly, the same poll found that 69% of Americans supported limits on greenhouse gas emissions as part of an international agreement (Stokes, et al. 23).

			<p>
				It is important to note that the Harris poll used the words “global warming”, while Pew (in alignment with most current academia) referred to it as “climate change”. Global warming is an inaccurate term deemed by most scientists to be misleading, getting to only part of the problem and missing out on the larger picture. It is possible that people have rejected the term global warming, but are more accepting of the term climate change. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Nevertheless, there continues to be a significant portion of the public who deny climate change and its long term effects. 2007 saw major consensus between both parties that climate change needed to be addressed, but little legislation was passed once it became clear the kinds of drastic measures that would be necessary to limit climate change. The denial argument (in the US) is fueled by big oil and coal companies, along with major Republicans and science skeptics.
			</p>
			<p>
				An article published in The Nation found that ExxonMobil, one of the world’s leading producers of oil and gas, was warned by its scientists of the risks of climate change. This was in 1977, when the public was largely unaware of the threat that fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions posed. In the 7 years between 1998 and 2005, when climate change began to make headlines and public awareness rose, Exxon’s foundation gave approximately $15M in funding to organizations that question climate science (Hertsgaard, 4). With powerhouses like ExxonMobil who profit from oil and gas funding the argument against climate change, it’s easy to see how an argument that denies scientific analysis without any science gained widespread traction. Further analysis behind the strategies climate change denial shows no significant scientific argument against climate change. Most denial arguments stem from ignorance, belief in conspiracy, or concern about the economic effects of climate change action.

				Researchers at the University of Central Florida monitored Twitter in the month that Hurricane Sandy hit New York City in 2012. They found that while coverage of Hurricane Sandy was abundant, there were spikes in people racing to Twitter to speak for/against climate change. Among those tweets that were denying, the words “fraud, deception, fake, hoax, and lie” were excessively used. This sort of denial is not skepticism, as the report notes, rather it is “a discourse of certainty” (Jacques and Knox, 838-845). Although Twitter is not the best way to obtain an accurate sample of deniers, it does provide a snapshot into the most vocal deniers, and the reasoning behind their arguments. The themes that showed up the most frequently on Twitter were opposition to renewable energy, increased taxation, and abuse of power and violation of public interest. As mentioned before, some of these arguments may be valid, but none provide a clear scientific argument against climate change. (Jacques and Knox, 841-846).

				Arguments from ignorance plague the opposition to climate change. Maureen Coyle made the psychological point that if you are unaware of the environmental damage your actions may cause, you are likely to continue your actions. This certainly is not the case for oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, but may be the case for fisherman who specialize in ocean floor trawling (83). Coyle also found a link between the deniers and their stereotyping of environmentalists as “tree-huggers, eco-terrorists, or nutters” (84). Ad homenims that become stereotypes only help to make climate change an even more divisive topic. This sort of behavior is indicative of social dominance orientation, a personality trait that has been linked to climate change denial.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kirsti Jylhä and Nazar Akrami from the Dept. of Psychology at Uppsala University created a study that found that social dominance orientation (SDO) to be the the strongest predictor of climate change denial (Jylhä and Akrami, 110). SDO is characterized by favoring an “in-group” over other “outgroups”, a preference for hierarchical society, and inclination towards science skepticism. Different researchers at the Uppsala University used the Big Five personality traits (Openness to experience, conscientiousness, neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness) and tested them with people who scored highly towards SDO. They found that SDO was negatively correlated with openness to experience and agreeableness, while positively correlated with conscientiousness (Ekehammar et al. 466).
			</p>
			<p>
				Big Five personality traits have shown to be predictors of how people vote. People who generally vote Republican score higher in conscientiousness, while scoring lower in openness to experience, and vice versa for those who vote Democrat (Mondak and Halperin, 336-340). This is not to say that all Republicans have SDO, but it is to say that people with SDO are usually found on the right, which explains part of why the majority of climate change denial comes from the right.
			</p>
			<p>
				Naomi Klein points out in The Nation that climate change triggers all of the right’s biggest fears – increased taxation & regulation, transitioning away from fossil fuels (or the economy’s powerhouse), and a revitalized social infrastructure (Klein 14-16). She brings up the point that the right’s argument against climate change is rooted in economics. In a time when voters’ biggest issue/concern in the 2016 presidential election is the economy – 84% of voters claiming the economy is “very important” to their vote, followed by 80% for terrorism, and 54% for the environment – it’s easy to see why the economic argument is taking precedence over the scientific one (Stokes et al.).
			</p>
			<p>
				Although the economic argument against climate change is the arguably the strongest, it is rarely enough to refute the scientific data available. Many have tried, claiming cold temperatures or bringing snowballs into congress as proof against climate change (Mazo 42). This sort of argument is concerning because it has no concern for fact. It reduces scientific fact to something one can have an opinion on. There remains a disparity as well between the arguments of some elected officials, who bring valid economic arguments to the table, and those of the likes of Donald Trump, claiming it to be a hoax and a fake. As long as this divide is perpetuated, little will be done to reverse the effects of climate change.
