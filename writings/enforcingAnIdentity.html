	<h3 class="writingTitles">Enforcing An Identity</h3>
	<p>
		Every country maintains an innate desire to maintain control over its public. This desire, however, varies greatly in respect to the style of government. On a broad level, this paper will examine the difference in methods used by communist and theocratic regimes to maintain control over their publics. More specifically, this paper will compare and contrast the Communist Soviet-controlled German Democratic Republic (1949-1990) with the Theocracy of the Islamic Republic of Iran (1970 – present) and both regimes use of public policy, law enforcement & surveillance in attempt to maintain a high degree of ideological control within their countries. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The former communist German Democratic Republic was founded in 1949 after the second world war, and was ruled by the totalitarian Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (SED, Socialist Unity Party of Germany). The SED controlled virtually every part of the GDR government and was largely successful in promulgating its communist message throughout the land. Enforcing its state message required building a propaganda machine that was the second largest intelligence gathering organization in the Soviet Bloc (Janos 1996, 14). The Stasi – secret police – of the GDR were a cunningly ruthless, invasive, and omnipresent propaganda tool that collected massive amounts of private data on citizens in attempt to eliminate all enemies of the state. It is precisely this administration in the GDR government that helps define the country as totalitarian – “[the regime] uses violence not so much to frighten people as to realize constantly its ideological doctrines and its practical lies” (Arendt 1973, 341). The Stasi’s use of violence was never rampant or public; it was always discreet and hidden: “vehicles used to transport detainees were disguised as refrigerated vans for seafood” (Funder 2007, 3). However, the public was aware of the Stasi’s operations; Joachim Heinrich lived in the GDR during the 1980s, and described the Stasi’s operations, “we knew we were being watched, but we got on with what we had to anyway” (Skelton 2010, 460). It was just the simple fact of knowing the Stasi was around that led people to behave and act in certain ways. 
	</p>
	<p>
		On the contrary, the authoritarian theocracy of Iran (Islamic Republic of Iran) is not as sophisticated in its method of public control; rather it is rogue and very public. Guided by faith in Islam, the majority Shi’a Muslim nation bases much of its civil policy on its faith. While there are popular elections in Iran, the Supreme Religious Leader of the nation – Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei – holds veto power on essentially all policy. This classifies Iran as a competitive authoritarian regime, which can be defined as a regime in which “formal democratic institutions are widely viewed as the principal means of obtaining and exercising political authority. Incumbents [Ayatollah Khamenei] violate those rules so often and to such an extent, however, that the regime fails to meet conventional minimum standards for democracy” (Levitsky & Way, 2002, 52). In his paper, Chehabi introduces Juan Linz’s definition of authoritarianism to apply to Iran: ‘political systems with limited, non-responsible political pluralism; without an elaborated and guiding ideology, but with distinctive mentalities; without extensive nor intensive political mobilization, except at some points in their development, and in which a leader, or, occasionally, a small group, exercises power from within formally ill-defined, but actually quite predictable, limits’. In this regard, the conservatives of the Iranian government attempts to enforce its version of Islamism through conservative vigilante group Ansar-E-Hezbollah, their public police force, formerly known as the Law Enforcement Force of Islamic Republic of Iran (NAJA), and a subsect of the NAJA called the guidance patrol, who specially seek out those who are not following public dress code in Iran. While Iran’s public police force is not as meticulous, as invasive, or as totalitarian as the Stasi of the German Democratic Republic, both regimes share a similarity in their desire to maintain a consistent ideology that permeates their entire respective nations. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Central to the policy of the Stasi was creating an ideal ‘“all-round developed socialist personality,’ initially based on the Marxist vision of the perfect human being” (Brauer 2012, 58). Khamenei has been quoted as saying the “constitution is secondary to Islam and religion” (Chehabi 2001, 63). Each regime wants its constituents to subscribe to specific ideology; communism and state socialism in the GDR and theocratic Islamism in Iran. These concepts can be examined at a policy level in both countries.
	</p>
	<p>
		The preamble to the East German criminal code states that the purpose of the policy was to “safeguard the dignity of humankind, its freedom and rights under the aegis of the criminal code of the socialist state” and that “a person can be prosecuted under the criminal code only in strictest concurrence with the law” (Koehler 1999, 18). Article 20 of Iran’s constitution states: “All citizens of the country, both men and women equally enjoy the protection of the law and enjoy all human, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, in conformity with Islamic criteria” (Maranlou 2015, 127). From a policy perspective, one can see the communist totalitarian traits of the GDR and the authoritarian theocratic traits of Iran, along with their mutual desire to enforce state ideology (GDR, socialism/communism; Iran, theocracy, Islamism). 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Stasi were indeed an incredibly sophisticated organization, which by the height of the regime, exercised “almost complete control over the captive population of East Germany” (Dennis 2003, 2).  The amount of resources and officers they had was colossal. At the height of its administration, the Stasi had as many as one secret policeman per 166 East German citizens, and 102,000 full-time officers (Koehler 1999, 9). They did not have many legal boundaries and were insistent on knowing everything – and everyone knew it. The Germans coined the term flächendeckend, meaning “nothing left uncovered” (Koehler 1999, 147) to describe the Stasi philosophy. The Stasi were known to bore tiny holes in apartments and hotel walls for placing tiny video cameras meant to record subjects; they would even tap bathrooms – a respect for privacy was institutionally absent from the department. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps the most chilling method used by the Stasi was their use of the extensive informer or inoffizielle Mitarbeiter (IMs). These people were anywhere from 18 to 60 years old, and were deeply sympathetic to the socialist policy of the SED and the GDR. Their role was a deceitful one: to observe and report back on friends, colleagues or even family members suspected to be “enemies of the state.” By 1995, 174,000 people had been identified as IMs, or 2.5% of the GDR’s population at the time (Koehler 1999, 8). To take this a step further, the Stasi would hire Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter der Konspiration (IMKs), who would rent out their rooms in apartment complexes to the Stasi, for surveillance on tenants of the complex/building (Skelton 2010, 459). When the numbers of the Stasi police force and the IMs, along with IMKs, the ratio of spy to citizen was 1 to 66. If the part-time IMs and IMKs are added, then the ratio drops to 1 informer to 6.5 citizens (Koehler 1999, 9). 
	</p>
	<p>
		Film provides an artistic rendering of history, and gives intimate perspective to the way some societies were or are. The above Stasi methods can be seen in the film Das Leben Der Anderen (The Lives of Others). A cut scene in the film shows Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler and his colleagues entering playwright Georg Dreyman’s apartment to install wires, tap the phone, and looking through private documents. Wiesler then goes upstairs to the attic (a room that could’ve possibly been rented out by an IM) and creates a workspace from where he would monitor and surveil Dreyman. This depicts the intimacy between Stasi officers and citizens of the GDR, and the omnipresence of the Stasi.  
	</p>
	<p>
		The NAJA of Iran are larger than the Stasi were, employing around 200,000 officers, however, the NAJA does not surveil their public to the meticulous extent of the Stasi. Since their country is largely based off of the texts of Islam, the police of Iran play a moral role in law enforcement. Through the means of their police force, the Iranian government is able to enforce various sorts of religious rules on its public. Due to this, it can be argued that the Iranian civil law is more discriminatory than the Stasi ever was. In Iran, homosexuals, rebellious youth, and women have to deal with constant fear of the NAJA or their moral department, the Guidance Patrol. The Guidance Patrol is mainly responsible for looking out for citizens who are not following moral law – women with their headscarf too low, young folks taking drugs or partying, or even homosexuals engaging in lavat, the Iranian term for sodomy, which is punishable by death. Sentences for being caught by the guidance patrol can fall under the category of unusual punishment – public lashings and beatings (Sanei 2010, 30; Maranlou 2015; 128). 
	</p>
	<p>
		The more violent faction of Iranian ideology enforcement is not a part of the NAJA or even the national government. The Ansar-e Hezbollah are “vigilantes” who are “paid for and organized by hard-liners in Iran’s government” (Molavi 2003, 16). They carry out some of the most violent acts against those who do not agree with the theocratic rule. They have been known to detain student leaders at gunpoint, lashing students with chains. In one instance, they threw a student out a window to his death. They have been linked to the killings of numerous dissidents and opposition writers. (Molavi 2003, 16). 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Iranian police force, along with Ansar-e Hezbollah, are evidently much less discrete than the Stasi was, but their targets are clearer. The Iranian groups single out certain “immoral” factions, while the Stasi is more focused on eliminating all “enemies of the state.” 
	</p>
	<p>
		This is not to say that the Stasi does not target specific groups – in fact they do – but only if those groups are deemed “enemies of the state”. Two specific groups in East Germany came under this blanket – Jehovah’s Witnesses and Punks. While the GDR was highly successful in maintaining high control over most of its citizens, it was not immune to the influence from the West – broadcast media from West Germany and older generations who were around before World War two influenced small pockets of dissent in the GDR. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Jehovah’s Witness population in the GDR was primarily older folk, who had been in East Germany since the late 19th/early 20th century. According to the GDR, they were of “state interest” due to their “imperialist strategy to undermine and liquidate the socialist order of the GDR” (Dennis 2003, 152). They were officially described as “hindering or preventing the formation of a socialist consciousness in children and young people, opposing German-Soviet friendship …  propagating superstition and hostility to science …  and spreading in social society the anxiety, uncertainty and fear in their daily lives and for the future such as is found in bourgeois capitalism” (Dennis 2003, 153). While the GDR did not prohibit religious plurality, they certainly repressed it a great deal, especially in the earlier years of the country. The state promoted atheism and saw religion as a hindrance to unity. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The punk music scene of the GDR started gaining traction in the 1981-82, and it didn’t take long for the Stasi to notice. They characterized the punk youth as “of weak character, disoriented, easily influenced and shaped by the Western enemy, antisocial, Degenerate, and lacking in belief of socialist ideals”. They were condemned for “grossly violent actions and thinking” and “glorifying individualism” (Brauer 2012, 59). 
	</p>
	<p>
		Interestingly enough, religious groups and punks became very close in the 1980s. Churches would provide spaces for punk musicians to practice their music, and punks would “increasingly participate in church events” (Brauer 2012, 59). This allowed the Stasi to surveil the punk youth and the religious dissidents at the same time. By 1983, less than 18 months from when the punk movement in GDR started to grow, the Stasi collected records on approximately 900 youths of the Punk movement (Brauer 2012, 57). By 1985, the Stasi had imprisoned up to 1,150 Jehovah’s Witnesses for up to 18 months at a time. The Stasi viewed these people as a barrier to imposing socialist ideology on the public, especially the youth: “The importance of youth has consistently grown in the class struggles of the last decades. The conflict between socialism and imperialism is always a battle for winning over the young generations” (Brauer 2012, 57). 
	</p>
	<p>
		This battle of winning over the young generations is also one that Iran attempts to enforce through policy, however, conservative Islamic law in Iran does not obstruct young people from rebelling. In Iran, holding hands in public is illegal, showing affection in public is grounds for public lashing. Dress code is strictly enforced for women, and a woman smoking in public is domain for arrest (Effendi 2010, 75-76). In the film Persepolis, a scene where Marjane is walking outside and wearing makeup, the guidance patrol is seen coming up to her because she was wearing makeup. The only way to get out of it was to blame a bystander who was looking at her. The police force in Iran is more concerned with the protection of Islamic morality than the safety of the public, as it systematically “fails to protect poor and disadvantaged groups” (Maranlou 2015, 92). Instead the police force focuses large amounts of time collecting surveillance (not to the methodical extent of the Stasi, but nevertheless) to rid their society of “moral oppressors”. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The NAJA in Iran use two primary tactics to crackdown on immoral activity in the private realm – raids of private homes and internet surveillance of suspected LGBT online chatrooms/websites (Sanei 2010, 50). Online chat rooms have been infiltrated by security forces in Iran in an attempt to crack down on the LGBT community in Iran. Police go undercover on internet LGBT chat rooms to talk to Iranian gay men and convince them to meet up. During these “meet ups” the gay men are arrested on the spot by the police, and asked multiple times if they engage in lavat, which is by law punishable by death (Sanei 2010, 55). 
	</p>
	<p>
		There are many reports of young people having secret parties that have been raided by the police in Iran, looking for people having premarital sex or consuming alcohol or drugs. In the film Persepolis, we see a depiction of this. The protagonist, Marjane, attends a party at a friend’s in Iran, which is raided by the police. While the women are arrested, the men and police engage in a rooftop chase where one of Marjane’s friends attempts to jump from a roof and ultimately falls to his death. This shows the fear that young people have of their repressive regime, as a government that tries to enforce its version of morality can end up oppressing people and in instances, forcing them to choose gambling with death over facing arrest and criminal prosecution.
	</p>
	<p>
		As mentioned, the Stasi were substantially more sophisticated in their surveillance tactics. Their wide database of information contained the most sensitive information in people’s lives, which Stasi officers would use to privately intimidate citizens into behaving. This method was called Weidergutmachung, meaning “atonement” (Schmeidel 2008, 45-6). This blackmail method was largely successful for the Stasi, as it instilled terror without introducing violent methods. This blackmail method was seen in the German film Das Leben Der Anderen (The Lives of Others). Towards the beginning when Stasi officer Wiesler tells a tenant in Dreyman’s apartment building to never speak of his presence there, or her granddaughter may lose her place in university.  The Stasi would use this blackmail to hire IMs as well. If a person had an examination opened on him by the Stasi, he would likely lose his job, and be forced to become an IM through the Stasi. This was called zu seinem Gluck gezwungen, meaning “forced towards happiness” (Schmeidel 2008, 45-6). 
	</p>
	<p>
		Communism and Theocracy as represented by the German Democratic Republic and the Islamic Republic of Iran, respectively, display a strong hankering to eliminate all forms of ideological dissent in their countries. While the GDR is more focused eliminating political enemies, like that of Georg Dreyman in Das Leben Der Anderen, Iran also attempts to eliminate political enemies, using vigilante groups, but unilaterally focuses more on eliminating moral enemies, those who do not follow the strict edict of Islamic law. Juliane Brauer (2012) points out that Stasi training materials “offer an important insight into the processes by which simple violations of moral, social, and cultural norms or redefined as criminal acts” (64). When examining Iranian law enforcement policy and methods, it is undeniable that Iran also redefines moral, social, and cultural norms as criminal acts. One Iranian official even pointed out the increasing importance of “crowd control and dissent management” (Molavi 2003, 16). Both regimes use law enforcement, who are supposed to protect people from danger, to instead patrol their own citizens, in hopes of a more unilateral society. 
	</p>
	<p>
		These methods used by both regimes largely demonstrate a sentiment that is felt throughout governments of this style: a fear of losing control. In order to maintain ideological control, these regimes believe(d) in using force in various contexts to get people to behave. 
	</p>
	<p>
		 There is solace in the fact that the repression that the Stasi, the NAJA, guidance patrol and Ansar-e Hezbollah enforced was not and is not entirely successful. Opposition still existed in many forms in both societies. The policies in place did punish some people, but ultimately underground culture still existed in the GDR and exists in Iran today. Punks and Jehovah’s Witnesses still practiced their culture in the GDR, regardless of the Stasi’s Orwellian eye. In Iran, young people are more frequently engaging in underground parties, music performances, and political rallies. Protest and public discontent was vital in bringing down the Berlin wall, and vigorous protests exist today in Iran. Whether that will change in the immediate future is still to be seen, but it does provide hope that in the face tyrannical oppression, it is increasingly difficult to suppress mass opposition and to maintain a consistent ideology throughout all citizens.
