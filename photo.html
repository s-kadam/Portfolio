					I've been taking photos ever since I was the age of 16. I got hooked the first time someone had shown me that you could take a picture of an object in the complete darkness with a DSLR (long exposure). My mind was blown. Ever since then, I've been documenting the world I see around me. I take thousands of photos every year and I love doing it.

					Sometimes, I take photos with a DSLR camera and sometimes, I shoot with an analog film camera. You can find some of my work on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/snkadam/">Instagram</a>.

					During the years 2015-2018, I took photos with the Red & Black Newspaper in Athens, GA. It was by far one of the most fun jobs I've ever had. I was given the opportunity to take photos of some amazing people and events. I got to take picutres of Michael Phelps and the US National Swim team before they went to the Olympics. I got to take pictures of a then-candidate Trump rally. I got to be front row to see Arrested Development while taking photos of them. I got to be on the sidelines in Sanford Stadium, taking pictures of 92,000 fans cheering on their Georgia Bulldogs. The few years I formally spent as a photojournalist were years I look back on fondly. Any opportunity to take photos of events or news would be very welcome.
